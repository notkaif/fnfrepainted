    <h1>Friday Night Funkin' Repainted</h1>
<strong>This is the official GitHub repository of the Friday Night Funkin' Repainted mod.<strong> To install replace your ingame files with the installed file. I recommend installing this via Github Desktop, using Git or downloading each file individually. The game can be found on Gamebanana too, once we have finished development.
